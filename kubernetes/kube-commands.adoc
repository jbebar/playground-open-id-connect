= Commands to deploy in kubernetes sample app

== Deploy pods

Deploy only one instance using kubectl create deploy :

[source,shell]
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n default

We should see the deployed pods after a minute :

[source,shell]
kubectl get po -n default


== Add a service to pods

The pods are deployed but for other pods to be able to contact the pods without knowing the ip of the pod, we can deploy a service that will expose this pods in a single ip to the rest of the cluster.

[source,shell]
kubectl apply -f service.yaml -n default

We should see the deployed service :

[source,shell]
kubectl describe svc playground-oidc-service -n default

Request a pod using the internal ip of the service :

[source,shell]
kubectl run -i -t busybox --image=busybox --rm --restart=Never -- wget -qO- http://10.1.0.88:8080/api/public

Should return :

{"message":"All good. You DO NOT need to be authenticated to call /api/public."}pod "busybox" deleted
